# QuizletEmu

Emulates Quizlet, the popular study tool.
Recently, Quizlet stopped being free, and I had plenty of terms to learn and inverse-plenty of money.

Reads a CSV or XLSX file of the term/definition pairs, and quizzes user until all are answered correctly. Missed terms are re-asked after some time (spaced repetition) for better retention.
